# Developer Guide

## Introduction

Trippie is a command-line app to plan any of your upcoming trips. It is tailored to match the needs of student travellers. Trippie lets users plan multiple trips through timetabling and also allows users to track their expenses overseas. Trippie is designed for users to enter their input quickly and efficiently.

## Setting up the project in your computer

**Prerequisites:**
* JDK 11
* IntelliJ IDE

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

âš  **Caution:**

Follow the steps in the following guide precisely. Things will not work out if you deviate in some steps.
</div>

First, **fork** this repo, and **clone** the fork into your computer.

If you plan to use Intellij IDEA (highly recommended):
1. **Configure the JDK**: Follow the guide [_[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the JDK_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijJdk.html) to to ensure Intellij is configured to use **JDK 11**.
1. **Import the project as a Gradle project**: Follow the guide [_[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Importing a Gradle project_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html) to import the project into IDEA.<br>
  :exclamation: Note: Importing a Gradle project is slightly different from importing a normal Java project.
1. **Verify the setup**:
   1. Run the `seedu.trippie.Trippie` and try a few commands.
   2. [Run the tests](Testing.md) to ensure they all pass. 

## Design & Implementation

This section explains the high-level design of the application. Given below is an overview of each component and a more detailed explanation of the architecture. Trippie is the main class which manages the initialization of the relevant classes and their execution.

Figure 4 above shows the various exception classes used to handle the different errors met.

**`Trippie`** has one class called [`Trippie`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/trippie/Trippie.java?) It is responsible for:
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The rest of the App consists of three components.
- **UI** : The UI of the App.
- **Parser** : Parses user input and its information to respective commands.
- **Storage** : Reads data from, and write data to, the text file.
- **Command** : Executes each command respectively.

The Sequence diagram below shows how the program flows across the different classes when parsing or executing user commands.

### Product scope

#### Target user profile

- Students who loves to travel.
- Students going on exchange trips e.g. Student Exchange Program (SEP), NUS Overseas College (NOC).
- Students who like to challenge themselves to plan for their own trips.
- Students who seek convenience in tracking their expenses under the same planning application.

#### Value proposition

It allows users to plan multiple trips in a one-stop platform before and during the trip. It provides user with a convenient method of tracking expenditure while not spending past their budget. It also allows user to quickly convert any amount from local to foreign currency, vice versa.
